## Research overlook

*	In-situ monitoring of micro-filaments for electrohydrodynamic ink-jet printing using machine vision

Electrohydrodynamic ink-jet printing (e-jet printing) is one of micro/nanoscale 3D printing techniques that automatically deposit functional materials to form 3D structures on the substrate. Unlike traditional thermal or acoustic inkjet printing, e-jet printing utilizes high electrical forces that enable the ink to overcome surface tension at the tip of microneedles. The filaments/droplets coming out from the needle have dimensions much smaller than the dimensions of the nozzle, thus printing geometries in micro and nanoscale. Process parameters in e-jet printing could affect the final quality attributes of fabricated constructs. Currently, assessment of these critical geometries and attributes must be performed offline using optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. This drawback affected the efficiency of micro/nano printing from translation into industrial practice. The research in this paper focused on fundamental research to enable in-situ monitoring of e-jet printing using a real-time image characterization technique. In conclusion, the study in this paper investigated using machine vision for real-time monitoring of micro scale 3D printing. The method worked well for characterization of micro-filaments, and may be further implemented into feedback control system of complicated e-jet printing. However, the optical machine vision was limited to micro scale detection. One of the future research topic is to develop nano scale in-situ characterization mechanism for e-jet printing.

*	3D printing and characterization of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and methylcellulose for biodegradable support structures

The currently available support materials used with 3D printing technology have challenges of poor dissolvability in chemical solution and difficulty to be removed from the finished part. Current support materials are usually petroleum based which has a negative impact on the environment. The goal of the project is to identify a suitable biomaterial for support structures that will eliminate the challenges of poor dissolvability and toxic waste generated by the current material. In this study, three biodegradable cellulose derivatives of methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), with different degree of substitution of hydroxyl group were used. We investigated the effect of concentrations (8, 10, and 12% w/v) of various cellulose derivatives on the rheological properties for understanding their printability. The rheological analysis revealed that all hydrogels exhibit shear-thinning properties with relatively low yield stress. Effects of printing parameters (extrusion rate, nozzle diameter, and printing speed) were optimized to obtain the desired three-dimensional structures. The water dissolution of the MC and HPMC hydrogels allowed easy removal of the support structures from the build material. Biopolymers like MC and HPMC help in moving closer towards sustainable manufacturing.

*	Laser ablation of polymers

Laser ablation (LA), which employs a pulsed laser to remove materials from a substrate for generating micro‐/nanostructures, has tremendous applications in the fabrication of metals, ceramics, glasses and polymers. It has become a noteworthy approach for achieving various functional structures in engineering, chemistry, biology, medicine and other fields. Polymers are one such class of materials; they can be melted and vaporized at high temperature during the ablation process. A number of polymers have been researched as candidate substrates in LA, and many different structures and patterns have been realized by this method. The current states of research and progress are reviewed from basic concepts to optimal parameters, polymer types and applications. The significance of this paper is to provide a basis for follow‐up research that leads to the development of superior materials and high‐quality production through LA. In this review, we first introduce the basic concept of LA, including mechanism, laser types (millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond, picosecond and femtosecond) and influential parameters (wavelength, repetition rate, fluence and pulse duration). Then, we focus on several commonly used polymer materials and compare them in detail, including the effects of polymer properties, laser parameters and feature designs. Finally, we summarize the applications of various structures fabricated by LA in a variety of areas along with a perspective of the challenges in this research area. Overall, a thorough review of LA of several polymers is presented, which could pave the way for characterization of future novel materials.

*	In-situ monitoring of electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing via scalar diffraction for printed droplets 

Electrohydrodynamic inkjet (e-jet) printing is a technique which utilizes electrical forces to generate droplets in micro/nano scale using conductive inks. Currently, there is no procedure in place to measure the printed patterns without taking the sample away from the printer setup. Removal of the substrate from the printing stage during the e-jet printing process prevents any additional work from being performed on the sample. We investigated the application of scalar diffraction for the in-situ measurement and digital reconstruction of opaque material printed on transparent substrates. Measurement and characterization of the printed material can be achieved in-situ to alter printing condition in process for quality assurance. In order to accomplish the sample reconstruction, a digital recording of a scalar diffraction pattern in the image plane was employed in this paper with a magnification of 5× with the help of a combination of lenses. The reconstructed images were then compared to images captured by an offline high-resolution microscope. The results indicated a submicron accuracy of the feature radii and the locations of feature centers. In addition to the quantitative measurements, this method also allows for the operator to view the overall form of the printed patterns. Our findings demonstrate an effective approach for in-situ monitoring of e-jet printing and printed patterns, which could pave the way for the industrial application in printing testing field.

*	Fabrication of micro-scale radiation shielding structures using tungsten nanoink through electrohydrodynamic inkjet printing

Electronics components used in space and strategic missions are exposed to harsh radiation environments, which could cause operational malfunction of the system through lattice displacement or ionization effects. One potential solution is to use tungsten as radiation shielding. Tungsten is a very effective material in shielding electronic components and manufacturing gratings for x-ray imaging. However, intrinsic properties of tungsten (e.g. density, chemical/thermal inertness and hardness) post a significant challenge of fabricating the material into micro-scale and delicate structures, especially in electronic device fabrication. To address the problem, we designed a new tungsten nanoink and developed a straightforward approach to create tungsten micro-structures by 3D printing. Various microstructures down to 10 µm resolution have been patterned and fabricated by electrohydrodynamic inkjet (e-jet) printing using tungsten nanoink. By optimizing process parameters (voltage modality) and materials properties (ink formulation), the dimension and morphology of the structures can be precisely controlled. An AC-modulated voltage was employed during the e-jet printing process to make the patterns much more controllable and stable. Multi-layer tungsten lines were characterized by x-ray imaging and exhibited excellent absorption of x-ray radiation. With the same thickness, printed lines showed nearly 1/3 absorptivity of x-ray radiation of bulk tungsten, leading to significant radiation attenuation effectiveness. Tungsten nanoink is a new material used in e-jet printing that has not been reported in the literature to the best of authors' knowledge. The study establishes a new methodology of manufacturing micro-nano scale shielding components for electronic devices and rapid prototyping of gratings and collimators in radiography for medical and inspection applications. The research also provides practical guidance to fabricate high melting-point metals via nanoink and micro/nano scale 3D printing.

*	Evaluation of cement paste containing recycled stainless steel powder for sustainable additive manufacturing

Cement is a key ingredient and the most widely used cementitious material in making concrete. Often, numerous materials are mixed with cement in the form of powders (that are mainly supplementary cementitious materials), fillers or others, to enhance the properties and applicability of concrete produced. In the last two decades, additive manufacturing has grown rapidly; however, large amounts of waste metal powder from additive manufacturing were generated at the same time. Metal powders are generally expensive, and recycling of such metal powder causes associated hazards and environmental stress. Incorporating metal powder into cementitious system may be a solution to utilize metal powders from the additive manufacturing industry and to improve the mechanical strength of cement part at the same time. In this study, a non-conventional Stainless Steel (SS) micropowder, of particle size 40–100 µm was used in cement paste mixture. SS powder is a new material to be used in the cementitious matrix that has not been reported in the literature to the best of authors’ knowledge. Properties of SS micropowder modified cement paste samples were characterized and compared to that of a control (reference) mixture. The results indicated that addition of 5% SS micropowder to cement paste (by volume of the mixture) was an optimum quantity that improved the strength and durability of the mixture whereas 2 and 8% SS addition had negative effects. Further study to explore its use at higher dosages as replacement of cement is recommended.

*	An area-depth approximation model of micro-drilling on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) soft films using pulsed laser ablation

Micro-drilling based on laser ablation has been widely applied for manufacturing micro/nano features on different materials as a non-contact thermal removal approach. It has the advantages of high aspect ratio manufacturing capability and reduced surface damage. However, laser ablation is a complicated process that is challenging to model, thus manufacturing accuracy and dimensional prediction are essential yet difficult aspects when a new substrate material is tested. In this paper, a standardized modeling procedure was demonstrated to predict the area and depth of laser ablation based on experimental study and simulation validation. A case study was conducted where micro-drilling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was investigated using a 1064nm nanosecond pulsed laser. Blind micro-holes were fabricated on the HDPE samples by ablating under different laser powers and number of pulses. Gain factors were defined and determined by the experimental data. A quantitative area-depth approximation model was formulated based on the gain factors and the Gaussian laser intensity profile, which can predict the ablated dimensions on the HDPE samples and enhance the control of manufacturing accuracy. A comparison of the measured and the simulated results of micro-holes presented average 96.5% accuracy for the area and 85.7% for the depth. This research provided a simple but effective approach to predict dimensions of micro-holes on various substrates using laser ablation under different laser power and the number of pulses, which could pave the way for development and modeling of laser ablation on polymers.
•	Correlation Approach for 3D Surface Measurement Data of Additive Manufactured Parts Based on Optical Metrology
Surface topography and surface finish are two significant factors for evaluating the quality of products in additive manufacturing (AM). AM parts are fabricated layer by layer, which is quite different from traditional formative or subtractive methods. Despite rapid progress in additive manufacturing and associated optical metrology for quality control and in-situ monitoring, limited research has been conducted to investigate the reliability of 3D surface measurement data. The surface topologies scanned by multiple optical systems demonstrated significant differences due to varying sampling mechanisms, resolutions, system noises, etc. The 3D datasets should be trustworthy in order to extract parameters for quality assurance or feedback control from 3D surface measurements. In this paper, we set up new standards to evaluate the reliability of 3D surface measurement data and analyze the variation in the topographical profile. In this study, two non-contact optical methods based on Focus Variation Microscopy (FVM) and Structured Light System (SLS) were adopted to measure the surface topography of the target components. The two optical metrology systems generated two entirely different point cloud datasets. Statistical methods were applied to test the difference between the data obtained from the two systems. By using data analytics approach for comparison, it was found that the surface roughness estimated from the point cloud data sets of FVM and SLS has no significant difference, though the point cloud data sets were completely different. This paper provides standard validation approach to evaluate the plausibility of metrology data from in-situ real-time surface analysis for process planning of AM.

*	Fabrication of Silver Microstructures via Electrohydrodynamic Jet Printing as Customizable X-ray Marker in Bio-scaffold for Biomedical Diagnostic Medical Imaging

Currently, X-ray marker for biomedical diagnostic in medical imaging was not flexible enough to accommodate the fast evolution of bio-scaffold applications, leading to a considerable performance gap. In this study, an electrohydrodynamic inkjet (e-jet) printed silver X-ray marker was fabricated to replace the traditional ones without increasing the cost or influencing the effectiveness of detection. Even though X-ray characterization of bulk silver has been studied, silver nanoink has demonstrated a different X-ray absorption response. This accounts for an immediate need to understand X-ray characterization of silver microstructures. In this paper, an e-jet printing system was applied to fabricate silver microstructures under optimized printing parameters such as voltage amplitude, pulse width, frequency, and printing speed. In order to compare the different X-ray characteristics between bulk silver and microstructures fabricated using silver nanoink, both silver lines with a single layer and multiple layers were fabricated. Microstructures, which were e-jet printed by silver nanoink, presented about 81% of the X-ray absorption rate to the bulk silver under the same radiation condition and thickness. Sub-30 μm microstructures of silver nanoink were achieved by e-jet printing; part of them will serve as the X-ray marker in bio-scaffold. This research proposed a method to bridge the e-jet printing technique with a customizable X-ray marker in bio-scaffold, which could effectively resolve the problem of flexibility, improve the resolution, and reduce the cost of manufacturing. And this novel approach supported the development of biomedical products which were fabricated by silver nanoink material such as in-vivo embedded bio-sensors in computed tomography applications.

*	Nonlinear consideration of the in-plane buckling analysis of the confined functionally graded porous arches with nanocomposites reinforcement subjected to radially-directed uniform loading

The   nonlinear   buckling of the functionally   graded porous(FGP) arches with nanocomposites reinforcement  is  studied  in  this  paper. Both  pores and nanocomposites  are distributed  symmetrically  to  the  mid-axis  of  the  cross-section. When  the  arch  is  encased  in  the elastic medium, the deformed shape of the arch can be described as a “single-lobe”, which can be expressed  precisely  by  a  cosine displacement  function. We obtained  numerical  and analytical solutions of  the  loading  capacity  by  employing  nonlinear  thin-walled  shell  theory, principle  of minimum  potential  energy, geometric  nonlinearities  and Riks technique. Both analytical and numerical results are successfully verified by other closed-form expressions. It is found that pores reduce loading  capacity,  while  a  small  addition  of  the  nanocomposites  increases the  loading capacity  of  FGP  arches  prominently. The  confinement  effect and parametric  evaluations are studied to  examine  the  effects  of  geometric  shapes  of  nanocomposites and  interface  friction  on loading capacity of FGP arches.
